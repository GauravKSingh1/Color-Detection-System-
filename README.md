# Color-Detection-System-
Color Detection System using Machine Learning Techniques- 
The system is based on supervised learning to determine the colour of objects in the image. It will detect the colour of an object from 
the given image using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The CNN will be trained on an image database containing known coloured objects. 
The system will show the colour of the object in the image with confidence in the prediction.The system can be used in many applications 
such as fruit and vegetable sorting, crop tracking and medical imaging.
